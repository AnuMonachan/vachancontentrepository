          "description": "Genesis which means beginning. It tells the story of how the world began and how God created all things, including animals of different kind and human beings both male and female., Moses, the Prophet, and the leader of Israel was an author of Pentateuch. The first book is Genesis. He wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. All together known as Torah which means law., Bible doesn’t tell exactly when and where Genesis was written, but it was probably written by Moses during the years of Israelites encampment in the wilderness at Sinai., And it may be written to early Israelites after their Exodus from slavery in Egypt before they entered to the land of Canaan.",

Ruth is the Hebrew title of this book means “friendship or association.” This book covers 30 years history. It is an incident that happened in the days of the judges., 2. Because of her faithfulness in a time of national faithlessness, God rewards her by giving her a new husband, a son, and a privileged position in the lineage of King David and Jesus the Messiah., 3. Ruth and Naomi are the major personalities in the first two chapters and Ruth and Boaz in the last two chapters. And in the first two chapters Ruth’s love is demonstrated and in the last two chapters Ruth’s love is rewarded. This book is an illustration of godliness, real faith and obedience that leads to blessings.",

Luke was a physician, missionary (associated with Paul in his mission) and above all, a historian. He was very careful both in his gospel and in the book of Acts to give accurate historical details. Luke wrote this historical account on Jesus to Theophilus probably a Roman official to establish him in the faith in Jesus Christ. Theophilus was a believer and then the purpose of the book was edification of the saint.Luke presents Jesus as ‘Son of Man’ ‘Perfect man’ and the key words in this gospel is ‘Salvation’ and ‘Son of Man’.",

Jesus’ brothers came to believe in Jesus as the Son of God later, after his resurrection., Jude wanted to expose the false teachers who had entered the Church and also, he wanted to encourage the Christians to stand firm in faith and guard themselves from the false teachings., Although it is one of the shortest books in the New Testament, the Epistle of Jude contains information that is not found anywhere else in the Bible. Jude portrayed Jesus as ‘Our Protector'., This epistle was probably written between A.D. 60 and 69 in Jerusalem.",
