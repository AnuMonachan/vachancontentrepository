luk,1,Introduction,"The Gospel of Luke is consisting of 24 chapters and is written by Luke, a physician, and a Gentile.He was a close companion of the Apostle Paul in his missionary journey also remained with Paul during Paul’s imprisonment in Rome.When and where; Luke began writing his account on Jesus probably at Caesarea and finished it in Rome between AD 65 and 70.Luke was a Greek, a gentile, therefore, he has written his gospel in a way that gentiles (non-Jew) would easily understand.In addition to this gospel Luke also wrote the book of Acts. Luke was a physician, missionary (associated with Paul in his mission) and above all, a historian.
